# Platform Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The platform is a comprehensive multi-client ecosystem designed for seamless marketplace interactions, built with a modern, distributed architecture spanning web, mobile, and API layers.

### Core Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js, GraphQL, Prisma ORM
- Frontend: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- State Management: React Context, GraphQL Resolvers
- Deployment: Containerized Microservices

### Key Architectural Principles
1. **Modular Design**: Leveraging monorepo structure with shared packages
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript integration across services
3. **Scalable GraphQL API**: Flexible, strongly-typed API layer
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Unified business logic across web and mobile

## System Components

### API Layer
Centralized GraphQL API providing core business logic and data access:
- Authentication resolvers
